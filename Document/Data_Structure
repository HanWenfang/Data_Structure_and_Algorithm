* MVC:xD
 	- Logical Structure
  	- Physical Structure
  	- Operation Sematics

* How many Physical Store Model?
	- Linear: continuous ~ O(1)
	- Link : not continuous but linked ~ O(n)
	- Hash : use hash id to retrieve the data ~ O(1)
	- DataBase ??

* Time Complexity
	O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(n^3) < O(2^n) < O(n!) < O(n^n)

* The Complete Operation Set of One Data Structure is the key to solve the Problem around IT.
