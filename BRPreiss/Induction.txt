"How to prove the equation is right!"

	when n=1, the equation is right.
	when n=m, the equation is right, then we could induct n=m+1 is right too!
	n is the variable.


some var:
	1. ordinary : n>b or n^2>2n
	2. n=1,2,3,4,5,6..., the equation is right.
	3. n=m+2....
	4. recursive: T(n) = T(n-1)+t , from big to small
