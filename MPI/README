	program pattern!! -- The Essential of Programming [Patterns]

	1. Initialize the walkers.
	2. Progress the walkers with the walk function.
	3. Send out any walkers in the outgoing_walkers vector.
	4. Receive new walkers and put them in the incoming_walkers vector.
	5. Repeat steps two through four until all walkers have finished.

	To increase the communication, not decerease. To avoid deadlock by communication.
